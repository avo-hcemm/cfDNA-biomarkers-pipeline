long_description: |
  **biomarkersearch-pipeline** is a bioinformatics workflow for identifying biomarkers 
  from sequencing data derived from cell-free DNA in human plasma samples. 
  The identified biomarkers can be used in downstream clinical applications, 
  such as PCR-based screening and diagnostic tests.

  The Galaxy-based interface allows users to upload data and monitor workflow execution. 
  The Galaxy server interacts with the SLURM scheduler to submit jobs on HPC clusters.

  **Key features:**
  - Preprocessing, alignment, and statistical analysis of cfDNA sequencing data  
  - Supports large datasets (100+ samples) and multiple cohorts  
  - Integrates a custom Java tool with standard bioinformatics utilities  
  - Available for local installation or Docker-based use
