tool: biomarkersearch-pipeline
version: "1.0.0"
description: >
  This container provides a bioinformatics pipeline to identify biomarkers from sequencing data derived from human plasma samples. 
  The biomarkers can be used in downstream clinical applications such as PCR-based screening and diagnostic tests.

  The pipeline performs preprocessing, quality filtering, alignment, and statistical analysis of DNA sequencing data. 
  It outputs genomic regions (~200 bp) that are significantly enriched in case vs control groups â€” serving as candidate biomarkers.

    description: >
      Paired-end FASTQ or FASTQ.GZ files containing sequencing reads from plasma samples. 
      Must be organized per sample and match entries in the sample annotation file.

  - format: fasta
    description: >
      Adapter sequence file in FASTA format, used for trimming sequencing adapters.

  - format: csv
    description: >
      Sample annotation file (e.g., datainfo.csv) listing sample IDs, case/control labels, 
      and paths to paired-end FASTQ files.

 - format: csv
  description: >
    Genome annotation file (e.g., genomeinfo.csv). Each row specifies a chromosome name and the full path to its corresponding FASTA file.
